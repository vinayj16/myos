## üéØ **Realistic Implementation Strategy**

Given the current codebase, I'll focus on implementing features that:
1. **Build on existing foundation** - Enhance what's already working
2. **Provide visible improvements** - Features users can see and interact with
3. **Are technically feasible** - Within scope of current architecture
4. **Add real value** - Meaningful functionality improvements

## üìã **Next Steps**

I'll implement the most impactful features first:
1. **Enhanced Desktop Environment** - Better UI, themes, notifications
2. **Improved Applications** - More functional calculator, text editor, file manager
3. **Better Input Handling** - Keyboard shortcuts, mouse improvements
4. **System Utilities** - Task manager, system information
5. **Network Foundation** - Basic networking capabilities
